# Events List Application

**Fork the repo to your personal github accounnt. If you do not have access to the repo, please ask Ilko (ilko@enetpulse.com) or Silviya (silviya@enetpulse.com)**

- Complete and build the actual events list application using Vue 2
- **Optionally you can use Vue 3's Composition API, if you prefer, or make the application for both Vue 2 and Vue 3's Composition API**

## Aplication details:

- All the events, passed from the API, should be rendered in the template
- Making Single File components is recommended, but not mandatory
- The events should be sorted/ordered in this order:
    1) by start date
    2) by start time
- For the API call, you are free to use any npm module you want or JavaScript's Fetch API
- Application design (note that the colors and font size do not need to be exactly the same):
    ![Event List Design](/src/assets/enet-test-example.png)
- API url:
        https://enet-test.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data_structure.json
    
**If the design image is not available in the Readme file, you can find it in the project's assets folder**
- Responsive design is not mandatory

## After you are done

**Send us the application at: ilko@enetpulse.com and silviya@enetpulse.com**
